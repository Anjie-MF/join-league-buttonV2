## Project Overview

This project is a part of my portfolio to demonstrate my skills with **React** and **JavaScript**. The goal was to create a functional button component with clear, simple functionality and visually appealing design.

### Key Features:
- **React Component**: Built using React, although state management hasn't been implemented yet. This can be expanded in the future to handle interactions or dynamic content (e.g., tracking clicks).
- **Styled Button**: Custom CSS styles for the button, including background color, padding, and hovering effect.
- **Future Responsive Design**: While the button isn't fully responsive yet, plans are in place to make it adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/join-league-button.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd join-league-button
    ```
3. Install dependencies using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Visit the app in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast, modern build tool for React applications.
- **CSS**: Basic styling for the button component.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **state management** for dynamic interactions (e.g., tracking clicks, toggling text).  
- **Make the button responsive**: Adjust styling to ensure the button works across different devices.
- Refactor for **reusability** by using props to allow for dynamic button text and styling.
- Add **unit tests** for button functionality to ensure expected behavior.


## Learning Experience

This project has helped me deepen my understanding of React and JavaScript fundamentals. It has also given me experience with Vite, improving my development workflow.
